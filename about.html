    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello all, and welcome to Ortho Fasting! This is a simple page dedicated to collecting suitable fasting recipes for the average Orthodox Christian to utilize.<p>

    <h1>Values</h1>
    <p>The goal of each recipe is simple. Follow the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. What this means to the author of Ortho Fasting is:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Follow the general guidelines for each fast,</b> which includes abstaining from meat and animal products (such as dairy and eggs), olive oil, alcohol, and fish. Spineless creatures such as shrimp and oysters are permitted.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid substitutions.</b> This mainly means not buying highly processed vegan alternatives such as fake beef, turkey, etc. because trying this hard to replace what you are meant to fast from is moving away from the spirit of the law, despite keeping within the letter. What this does not include might be something like replacing chicken with tofu or shrimp in a recipe that usually would have chicken, like tacos, for example.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid high-cost ingredients and lengthy prep and cook times.</b> It can be tempting to want a delicious well prepped lobster with all the bells and whistles when all you've been eating is beans for weeks. However, I and many others would argue this is not within the spirit of the law. Something like lobster is now considered a luxury and is expensive, like many other seafoods are. The money you put toward an expensive dish could be dedicated to almsgiving instead, which is another, non-separable aspect of fasting. There is no doubt that it will be difficult to avoid pricey dishes when seafood is included, which many of my recipes do, but I try my best to not break the bank. Additionally, if you live in a place where fresh seafood is cheaper, then you will not have to worry as much. Along these lines, spending a lot of time cooking could also be considered as too much effort put into a dish when fasting meals are supposed to be simple. I am pretty lenient on what is considered "long cook times," and I allow idle wait times like in the case of a pressure cooker meal, mainly focusing on complexity.</li>
